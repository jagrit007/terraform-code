# Terraform Code Repository

This repository showcases my proficiency in Terraform, demonstrating my ability to manage infrastructure as code across various platforms and services. It encompasses a range of projects that highlight my experience in deploying and managing cloud resources, integrating with containerization tools, and implementing secure infrastructure practices.

## Project Structure

- **aws-full-project**: Comprehensive Terraform configurations for deploying a python-based Flask application on AWS, including networking, compute, and terraform provisioners.

- **import-infra-to-terraform**: Terraform project to demonstrate importing of existing infrastructure into Terraform state management, facilitating infrastructure as code adoption for legacy systems.

- **terraform-aws**: Modular Terraform code for provisioning various AWS services, demonstrating best practices in resource management and scalability.

- **terraform-docker**: Integration of Terraform with Docker to orchestrate containerized applications, showcasing infrastructure automation for microservices.

- **terraform-hashicorp-vault**: Configurations to deploy and manage HashiCorp Vault using Terraform, emphasizing secure secret management and access control.

- **terraform-workspaces**: Utilization of Terraform workspaces to manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) within the same configuration, ensuring consistency and isolation.

## Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: All configurations are managed through code, enabling version control, reproducibility, and collaborative development.

- **Modular Design**: Projects are structured into reusable modules, promoting maintainability and scalability across different environments and use cases.

- **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Demonstrates the ability to deploy and manage infrastructure across various platforms, including AWS and Docker.

- **Security Best Practices**: Implementation of secure configurations, such as managing secrets with HashiCorp Vault and enforcing access controls.

- **Environment Management**: Effective use of Terraform workspaces to handle multiple environments, ensuring consistent deployments and minimizing configuration drift.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Terraform Proficiency**: Expertise in writing and managing Terraform configurations for diverse infrastructure scenarios.

- **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Experience in provisioning and managing cloud resources, particularly within AWS.

- **Container Orchestration**: Ability to integrate Terraform with containerization tools like Docker for efficient application deployment.

- **Security Implementation**: Knowledge of implementing secure infrastructure practices, including secret management and access control.

- **Collaborative Development**: Familiarity with version control systems and collaborative workflows to manage infrastructure as code effectively

This repository serves as a testament to my capabilities in infrastructure automation and my commitment to adopting best practices in DevOps and cloud engineering.
